            The European Youth Parliament Cyprus offers its participants a unique learning
            experience. Every year, 500+ young people from both Cyprus and Europe join our
            activities. There are various ways to get involved - typically, the first step is to
            participate in one of our EYP sessions which take place throughout the year. At the same
            time, we hold various open events, discussion forums, workshops, trainings and panel
            discussions which you can join! Get in touch and follow us on social media to keep up to
            date with opportunities to take part in our activities.

          If you are a High-School Student aged 15-18, you can register individually to attend our
          EYP Day. If your school is interested in applying as a delegation of six students, then
          you are able to attend our Pre-Selection Days. Both events usually take place in March and
          April. Through these events, you could be selected to attend EYP Cyprus&apos; annual
          National Session in the Summer. If you are interested in attending either of these events,
          you can contact our HR members@eypcyprus.com to declare your interest or ask for further
          details.
